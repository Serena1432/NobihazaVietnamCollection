# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This FAQ page was created to address some common questions you may have while visiting this website. This English version is machine-translated.

## I. What is Nobihaza Vietnam Community Collection?

This website, created by [Serena1432](https://s1432.org), is designed to compile (almost all) Nobihaza games into one platform. The goal is to help Nobihaza players easily find and follow the games they enjoy.

Additionally, the site integrates with Discord (and later a chatbot) to synchronize and notify players about new games more efficiently!

## II. Searching for and Downloading Games

1. You can search for games through the categories on the [homepage](/) or [custom search](/search).
2. Click on a game to view its details.
3. Scroll to the **Download Game** section, download the game, extract the files, and play. Instructions are typically included in the description of each game.

## III. Game File Extraction Passwords

For game files uploaded by [Serena1432](/profile/1), the extraction password is `nbhzvn`.

Other uploaders may use different passwords, usually mentioned in the game description. However, it is recommended for all uploaders to use the same password as those uploaded by Serena1432.

## IV. Tools to Play Games

Some games require specific software or libraries to run. These are usually noted in the game description. Here’s a summary of commonly needed tools:
